KNIME Analytics Platform - Email Processing Integration is designed to manage emails from within a KNIME workflow e.g. 
downloading emails including attachments and moving processed emails into another email folder. The extension also 
provides a new email session port type which allows to decouple the email server login from the different email 
management tasks.

### Development Notes
